abstract: The exotic pet trade is linked to non-native species establishment and climate change compounds invasion risk, overwhelming management efforts. We characterize the world's largest market for exotic pets, providing a real-time snapshot of species with invasion potential, and assessed the current and future risk posed to native systems. We found a diverse marketplace of 1,178 terrestrial vertebrates, predominately tropical species. Using 2,818 brick-and-mortar stores we developed spatial models of propagule risk. Here we show future climate change threatens 194% increase in climate suitability which in turn equates to an 83% of total land area in the USA becoming suitable for invasion by 2080. Rapid growth in this industry is expected to exacerbate current findings, especially at southern most latitudes. The real-time nature of this study provides more actionable management information than outdated import data.
