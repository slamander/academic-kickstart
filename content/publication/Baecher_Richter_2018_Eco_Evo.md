abstract = "Woodland salamanders are among the most abundant vertebrate animals in tem-perate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because of their abundance, woodland  salamanders  are  responsible  for  the  transformation  of  nutrients  and translocation  of  energy  between  highly  disparate  levels  of  trophic  organization: detrital food webs and high-order predators. However, the spatial extent of wood-land salamanders‚Äô role in the ecosystem is likely contingent upon the distribution of their  biomass throughout  the  forest.  We sought  to  determine  if  natural  environ-mental  gradients  influence  the  fine-scale  distribution  and  density  of  Southern Ravine Salamanders (Plethodon richmondi) and Cumberland Plateau Salamanders (P. kentucki). We addressed this objective by constructing occupancy, co-occurrence, and  abundance  models  from  temporally  replicated  surveys  within  an  old-growth forest  in  the  Cumberland  Plateau  region  of  Kentucky.  We  found  that  Plethodon richmondi had  a more restricted fine-scale distribution than  P. kentucki (mean oc-cupancy probability [ùúì] = 0.737) and exhibited variable density, from <250 to >1000 individuals per hectare, associated with increased soil moisture and reduced solar exposure due to slope face. While more ubiquitously distributed (ùúì = 0.95), P. ken‚Äêtucki density varied from <400 to >1,000 individuals per hectare and was inversely related to increased solar exposure from  canopy disturbance and landscape con-vexity. Our data suggest co-occurrence patterns of P. richmondi and P. kentucki are influenced  primarily by abiotic conditions within  the  forest, and  that  populations likely  occur independently and  without  evidence of biotic  interaction.  Given  the critical role that  woodland salamanders play in the  maintenance  of forest health, regions  that  support  large  populations  of  woodland  salamanders,  such  as  those highlighted in this study‚Äîmesic forest stands on north-to-east facing slopes with dense canopy and abundant natural cover, may provide enhanced ecosystem ser-vices and support the stability of the total forest."
