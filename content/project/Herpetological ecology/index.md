**Reptile and Amphibian Ecology**  

*What’s causing the decline of southern dusky salamanders (Desmognathus auriculatus) in the Southeastern United States?*

Ever since the early 1980’s, the southern dusky salamander has been on a precipitous decline throughout the entirety of their distribution in the southeastern Coastal Plains. While the cause is unknown, hypotheses include: hydrologic disruption of natal habitat (a result of destructive rooting behaviors of feral swine, which were introduced and spread throughout the region where salamanders began to decline); habitat destruction due to widespread and pervasive land use and land cover change; widespread extinctions due to thermal intolerance under climate change; and the presence of a cryptic disease or pathogen.
Methods: Using a database of presence only and standardized survey data ranging from the mid 1800’s until present, I will model the spatiotemporal dynamics of southern dusky salamander’s distribution in the southeastern US. To model this phenomenon, I will use a quantitative method commonly employed to predict the spread of disease (e.g. Malaria) and for modeling spatial patterns in geologic processes, a marked log-gaussian cox point process model. With this approach, I intend to model the influence of various factors--feral swine, habitat destruction, climate change, transmission of disease--on the prevalence of southern dusky salamanders during the last 100 years.
