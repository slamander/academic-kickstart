**Home:**
This workshop is supported by the Southeast Climate Adaptation Science Center and is hosted by the University of Florida. The workshop leads are:
- Brett Scheffers, Assistant Professor
- Luke Evans, Post-doc
- Alex Baecher, PhD candidate‚Äù

Invited participants will provide their insight on invasive species habitat suitability and prevalence through an interactive web application created with R Shiny. This web app can be accessed this [interactive web page](https://joshcullen.github.io/invasive_spp_expert_elicitation/)

**About this workshop:**
The purpose of this workshop is to elicit expert knowledge on the current geographic range, habitat suitability, and ecological traits of established invasive species. Data will be collated across participants to derive estimates of current distribution as well as project future range shifts or expansions over time.
